1. Incident commander name:
   Quang Ngo

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   A malicious script executed by a hacker initiated three pods named moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight, utilizing the server's computational power for cryptocurrency mining. This significantly impacted the performance of other tasks.

3. Summary of what was affected:
   Pods hosting Falco, Prometheus, and Grafana were affected, as a portion of resources was diverted for cryptocurrency mining.

4. Summary of the impact:
   The cryptocurrency mining pods surged CPU and memory usage abruptly, leading to the crash of running pods due to the system's inability to handle the CPU peak.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
  To address this, the following command was executed:
   kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force
This is to ensure that all services are back up and running, normal and accessible.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   Monitoring tools like Grafana are essential to detect anomalies promptly in the system.
